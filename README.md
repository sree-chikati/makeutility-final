 ## About this Project
This is a personal project that is made for a friend who loves to shop for pendants. By using the framework Colly, I webscraped the Esty's Necklace Pendants page. I scraped for the name, original price, and the image of the displayed results. Using this information, I created a static site generator which displays the collected data in a neat manner that shows the latest necklace pendants added on the Etsy Page. This project was mainly built to showcase the Go skills I had learnt and to build something fun for a friend.

## Deployment
In a terminal window, clone the following in your desired directory: 
```bash
https://github.com/sree-chikati/makeutility-final.git
```
Navigate the the project and deploy by running:
